   				<p class="lead">
					I am a dedicated Computer Science and Engineering student at United International University, where I am majoring in Data Science. Throughout my academic 
					journey, I engaged extensively in robotics, contributing to numerous projects both at my university and in the Center for Artificial Intelligence and 
					Robotics (CAIR) lab. My hands-on experience spans various innovative projects, showcasing a strong integration of robotics and data science.</br>

					I was leading the UIU Mars Rover Team to develop AI-based systems for object detection and tracking. I gained hands-on experience tackling real-world 
					challenges through robotics and artificial intelligence. My recent work on a path-following robot to streamline organizational workflows reflects my drive 
					to create solutions that have a positive impact. Also, I am working on an autonomous underwater vehicle and leading this project.</br>

					Now, I am eager to deepen my knowledge by working alongside experienced professionals. I am excited to find mentors and collaborators who share his/her 
					enthusiasm for research, especially in robotics and data science. Through these partnerships, I hope to expand my skills and contribute to projects that 
					push the boundaries of technology.</p>

					 <h4>Autonomous Vehicle</h4>		      
					 <p>In 2022, I developed an Autonomous Vehicle project for the UIU Mars Rover Team, It was our first participation in the University Rover Challenge. One of the exciting aspects of this competition was the autonomy mission, where we had to create a robot that could operate independently, much like a little explorer on Mars. Picture a rover that can navigate rough terrain, gather samples, and complete tasks without any human control, using its sensors to avoid obstacles and make decisions on the go. It’s incredible to see how these smart robots could shape the future of space exploration.</p>
